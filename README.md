- Check the libraries and packages needed from `package.json` file under the dependencies object.
- Open two terminal windows (one for running Server and other for the UI).
- Start MongoDB service with sudo service mongod start.
- Run `npm start` to run server or use `npm run dev` to use nodemon package for detecting changes automatically.
